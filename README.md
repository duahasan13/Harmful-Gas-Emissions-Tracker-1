# 🌱 Harmful Gas Emissions Tracker

A web-based application that estimates a user’s **monthly environmental impact** by calculating harmful greenhouse gases:  
**Carbon Dioxide (CO₂), Methane (CH₄) from unrecycled waste, and Nitrogen Oxides (NOₓ) from vehicle exhausts**.  

The app converts all gases into **CO₂-equivalent (CO₂e)** to give an easy-to-understand footprint for households and individuals.
